# BookingEngineAutomic
This project is an assignment to develop a shopping cart system with special deals. The weekly specials are as follows:
* 3 for 2 deal on opera house tickets.
* Give a free sky tower tour for every opera house tour sold.
* The Sydney bridge climb will have a bulk discount applied, where the price will drop to $20 if someone buys more than four.

##Assumptions
* From the examples of the deals given, I'm making an assumption that the third deal drops the price of each Sydney bridge climb ticket *by* $20 instead of *to* $20
* The customer only gets a Sydney Sky Tower ticket for free with their Opera House Tour if they add it to their cart.
